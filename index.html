          <article>
            <p>
                Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
            </p>
      
            <p>
                It is used for:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                web development (server-side),
              </li>
              <li>
                software development,
              </li>
              <li>
                mathematics,
              </li>
              <li>
                system scripting.

                What can Python do?
            </header>
            <ul>
                <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
                <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
                <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
                <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
                <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
            </ul>
            <header>Why Python?</header>
            <ul>
                <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
                <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
                <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
                <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
                <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>

            <article>
                <p>
                    As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:
                </p>
                <p>
                   <code>print("Hello, World!")</code><br>
                    Hello, World!
                </p>
                <header>
                    Python Indentation
                </header>
                <p>
                    Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.Where in other programming languages
                    the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
                    Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example<br>
                    <code>
                    if 5 > 2:<br>
                      print("Five is greater than two!")</code>
                </p>

                <article>
                <p>
                    Comments can be used to explain Python code.
                    Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
                    Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

                    Creating a Comment
                </header>
                <p>
                    Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example<br><code>
                    #This is a comment<br>
                    print("Hello, World!")<br></code>
                </p>
                <header>
                    Multi Line Comments
                </header>
                <p>
                    Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
                    To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:<br>
                    Example<br><code>
                    #This is a comment<br>
                    #written in<br>
                    #more than just one line<br>
                    print("Hello, World!")<br>
                    Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
                    Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:<br>
                    Example<br>
                    """<br>
                    This is a comment<br>
                    written in<br>
                    more than just one line<br>
                    """<br>
                    print("Hello, World!")</code>
                </p>
                </article>

                    <p>
                        Variables are containers for storing data values.

                        Creating Variables
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        Python has no command for declaring a variable.
                        A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example<br><code>
                        x = 5<br>
                        y = "John"<br>
                        print(x)<br>
                        print(y)</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example<br><code>
                        x = 4       # x is of type int<br>
                        x = "Sally" # x is now of type str<br>
                        print(x)<br></code>

                    Python Numbers
                </header>
                <article>
                <p>There are three numeric types in Python:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code class="w3-codespan">int</code></li>
                    <li><code class="w3-codespan">float</code></li>
                    <li><code class="w3-codespan">complex</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:</p>
                <p>
                    Example<br><code>
                    x = 1    # int<br>
                    y = 2.8  # float<br>
                    z = 1j   # complex</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example<br><code>
                    print(type(x))<br>
                    print(type(y))<br>
                    print(type(z))</code>
                </p>
                </article>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Python-Strings">

                    <p>
                        Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.<br>
                        'hello' is the same as "hello".<br>
                        You can display a string literal with the print() function:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example<br><code>print("Hello")<br>print('Hello')</code>

                    <p>
                        Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:<br>
                        Example<br><code>a = "Hello"<br>print(a)</code>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:<br>Example<br><code>
                        You can use three double quotes:<br>
                        a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,<br>consectetur adipiscing elit,<br>sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt<br>ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""<br>
                        print(a)</code>
                    </p>
                    <header>
                        Strings are Arrays
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.<br>
                        However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.<br>
                        Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example<br><code>Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0):<br>
                        a = "Hello, World!"<br>print(a[1])</code>

                <p>
                    Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.<br>
                    Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.<br>
                    Lists are created using square brackets:<br>
                    Example<br><code>Create a List:<br>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>print(thislist)</code>
                </p>
                <header>
                    List Items
                </header>
                <p>
                    List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
                    List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
                </p>
                <header>
                    Ordered
                </header>
                <p>
                    When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
                    If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.
                </p>
                <header>
                    Changeable
                </header>
                <p>
                    The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
                </p>
                <header>
                    Allow Duplicates
                </header>
                <p>
                    Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:<br>
                    Example<br><code>
                    Lists allow duplicate values:<br>
                    thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]<br>print(thislist)</code>
                </p>

                    List Length
                </header>
                <p>
                    To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:<br>
                    Example<br><code> the number of items in the list:<br>
                    thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>print(len(thislist))</code>

                        A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.<br>

                        Since tuple are indexed, tuples can have items with the same value:<br>
                        Example<br>Tuples allow duplicate values:<br><code>

                <article>
                <p>Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.<br>
                    Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.<br>
                    A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.<br>                    
                    Sets are written with curly brackets.<br>                    
                    Example<br><code>
                    Create a Set:<br>                    
                    thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}<br>
                    print(thisset)</p></code>

                    Set Items
                </header>
                <p>
                    Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
                </p>
                <header>
                    Unordered
                </header>
                <p>
                    Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.<br>
                    Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
                </p>
                <header>
                    Unchangeable
                </header>
                <p>
                    Sets are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.<br>
                    Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.
                </p>

                    Duplicates Not Allowed
                </header>
                <p>Sets cannot have two items with the same value.<br>
                    Example<br>
                    Duplicate values will be ignored:<br><code>
                    thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}<br>

                    <p>Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.<br>
                        A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and does not allow duplicates.<br>
                        As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.<br>

                        If statement
                    </header>
                    <p>An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.<br>

                        Example<br>
                        If statement:<br><code>
                        
                        a = 33<br>
                        b = 200<br>
                        if b > a:<br>
                          print("b is greater than a")</p> </code>
                    <p>
                        In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".
                    </p>
                    <header>
                        Indentation
                    </header>
                    <p>Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.<br>

                        Example<br>
                        If statement, without indentation (will raise an error):<br><code>
                        
                        a = 33<br>
                        b = 200<br>
                        if b > a:<br>
                        print("b is greater than a") # you will get an error</p></code>
                        <header>Elif statement</header>
                        <p>The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".<br>

                            Example<br><code>
                            a = 33<br>
                            b = 33<br>
                            if b > a:<br>
                              print("b is greater than a")<br>
                            elif a == b:<br>
                              print("a and b are equal")</p></code>
                    <p>In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b are equal".</p>
                    <header>Else statement</header>
                    <p>The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.<br>

                        Example<br><code>
                        a = 200<br>
                        b = 33<br>

                        <p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).<br>
                            
                            This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.<br>
                            
                            With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.<br>

                    <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.<br>

                        You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.<br>
                        
                        A function can return data as a result.

                    <p>In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:<br>

                        Example<br><code>
                        def my_function():<br>
                          print("Hello from a function")</p></code>
                    <header>Calling a Function</header>
                    <p>To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:<br>

                        Example<br><code>
                        def my_function():<br>
                          print("Hello from a function")<br>
                        
                        my_function()</p></code>
